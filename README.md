# Tech-Tower-T-Heist
Hackathon Project: the challenge is to capture the Tech Tower "T" while exploring Georgia Tech's campus.
A text-based, point and click adventure called "Tech Tower T Heist". Players are guided through 8 locations around campus and must complete certain challenges to win objects that ultimately lead them to Tech Tower to attempt the heist. In the process, they learn things about Georgia Tech and the resources it offers.

Full game's backend is coded in Python (Full Game Backend file) and partially implemented in Python's GUI using Tkinter (Hackathon_Frontend file). Currently, the front-end supports the functionality of Mid-campus only.
